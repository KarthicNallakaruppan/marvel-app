# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js version **18 or above** installed on your machine.

### Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarthicNallakaruppan/marvel-app.git
cd marvel-app
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


### Build and Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment

I have deployed this project using Vercel. You can find the live demo here: [Live Demo](https://marvel-heroes-karthic-nallakaruppan.vercel.app/).

## Advantages of Using Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that offers several advantages:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Automatically generates static and server-rendered pages for improved SEO and performance.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, leading to faster load times and reduced server load.
3. **API Routes**: Simplifies the process of building API endpoints directly within the app.
4. **File-Based Routing**: Offers a simple way to create routes based on the file structure in the `pages` directory.
5. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Optimizes your application by loading only the necessary JavaScript for the page being viewed.
6. **Fast Refresh**: Provides an instant feedback loop for developers with hot reloading.
